# Job Application Tracker

## T2A2 - API Webserver Project

### R1

The problem I am trying to solve by building a job application tracker is to streamline the job application process for applicants.
In particular, I am trying to help facilitate a more organised way for job seekers to manage their job applications. Users of this app can add new applications, and record details such as the company name, position, and application status, as well as track interview dates and delete or update applications.
