# Job Application Tracker

## T2A2 - API Webserver Project

### R1

The problem I am trying to solve by building a job application tracker is to streamline the job application process for applicants.
In particular, I am trying to help facilitate a more organised way for job seekers to manage their job applications.
Users of this app can add new applications, and record details such as the company name, position, and application status, as well as track interview dates and delete or update applications.

### R2

The problem of streamlining the job application process for job seekers is worth solving mainly due to efficieny and organisation.
Job seekers usually apply to multiple positions across various companies, through various methods and websites. Without having a centralised system to manage applications, it can become challenging to keep track of deadlines, details and statuses of each application.
By providing this application tracker, users can organise their applications and job searches more efficiently, therefore ensuring that no opportunities are missed or that they are not applying twice for the same job across different job-seeking websites.

## R3

For this project, I will be using PostgreSQL as the database system.
I have chosen this database system due to the comprehensive set of featues included, such as, support for stored procedures and various data types.
Furthermore, it is effective and manipulating and managing data which is important for data such as job applications that are constantly changing.

The major drawback to using PostgreSQL is the complexity involved. Due to PostgreSQL's extensive feature set, this can make the system more complex to manage and figure. Fortunately, as I am not expecting large amounts of data to occur, this should not be too much of an issue.

## R4

an ORM is a software technique that allows developers to map object-oriented models to relational databases, therefore, simplifying the interaction between the code and the database. Key functionalities and benefits of using an ORM include:

-   Language Consistency: Developers can write code in their preferred programming language instead of writing SQL statements.
-   Object-Relational Mapping: The ORM establishes a mapping between application objects and database tables, automatically translating operations into SQL statements.
-   Simplified CRUD Operations: An ORM provides high-level APIs and methods for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations, reducing the complexeties of SQL commands.
